    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "A1. Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system. In Python, the multiprocessing module includes a very simple and intuitive API for dividing work between multiple processes. The more tasks you must do at once, the more difficult it gets to keep track of them all, and keeping the timing right becomes more of a challenge.\n",
    "This is where the concept of multiprocessing arises!\n",
    "A multiprocessing system can have:\n",
    "- multiprocessor, i.e. a computer with more than one central processor.\n",
    "- multi-core processor, i.e. a single computing component with two or more independent actual processing units (called “cores”)."
